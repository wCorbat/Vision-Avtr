            <p class="about">VISION AVTR – inspired by<br> AVATAR.</p>
            <p class="text-about">
                The name of the groundbreaking concept vehicle stands not only for
                the close collaboration in developing the show car together with the
                AVATAR team but also for ADVANCED VEHICLE TRANSFORMATION. This concept
                vehicle embodies the vision of Mercedes-Benz designers, engineers and
                trend researchers for mobility in the distant future.</p>

            <div class="intern-1">
                <img class="img" src="./Imagens/interno 6.png" alt="">
                <p class="head_parag_1">The vehicle as an immersive<br> experience space.</p>
                <p class="parag_1">The visual connection between passengers and the outside
                    world is created by the curved display module, which replaces a conventional
                    dashboard. The outside world around the vehicle and the surrounding area is
                    shown in real-time 3D graphics and at the same time shows what is happening
                    on the road in front of the vehicle. Combined with energy lines, these detailed
                    real-time images bring the interior to life and allow passengers to discover and
                    interact with the environment in a natural way with different views of the outside
                    world.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="intern-2">
            <img class="img" src="./Imagens/interno 1.png" alt="">
            <p class="head_parag_2">Intuitive control.</p>
            <p class="parag_2">The VISION AVTR already responds to the approach of the passengers
                by visualising the energy and information flow of the environment with digital
                neurons that flow through the grille through the wheels to the rear area. The first
                interaction in the interior between man and vehicle happens completely intuitively
                via the control unit: by placing the hand on the centre console, the interior comes
                to life and the vehicle recognises the driver by his breathing. This is made visible
                on the instrument panel and on the user’s hand. The VISION AVTR thus establishes a
                 biometric connection with the driver and increases his awareness of the environment. </p>

            <p class="head_parag_3">Interior and exterior merge.</p>
            <p class="parag_3">For the first time, Mercedes-Benz has worked with a completely new
                design approach in the design of the VISION AVTR. The holistic concept combines the
                design disciplines interior, exterior and UX from the first sketch. Man and human
                perception are the starting point of a design process from the inside out. The design
                process begins with the experience of the passengers and consciously focuses on the
                perception and needs of the passengers. The goal was to create a car that prolongs the
                perception of its passengers. It was also a matter of creating an immersive experience
                space in which passengers connect with each other, with the vehicle and the surrounding
                area in a unique way.</p>

            <p class="head_parag_4">Sustainable materials.</p>
            <p class="parag_4">Large areas such as the back shell of the seat and the sky are decorated
                with a colour-changing fabric inspired by the colour world of the sea. Depending on the
                light, the textile changes its colour from dark blue to a subtle light blue. These seats
                are refined by the vegan DINAMICA® leather. DINAMICA® is the first and only microfibre that
                guarantees environmental sustainability throughout the entire production cycle. It is recycled
                material made from old clothing, flags and PET plastic bottles. During production, attention
                is paid to low pollutant emissions and low energy consumption.</p>

                <p class="head_parag_5">Masterpiece of efficiency.</p>
                <p class="parag_5">At Mercedes-Benz, the consideration of efficiency goes far beyond the drive
                    concept, because with increasing digitalisation, the performance of the large number of
                    so-called secondary consumers also comes into focus – along with their efficient energy supply,
                    without negatively affecting the drive power of the vehicle itself. Energy consumption per
                    computing operation is already a key target in the development of new computer chips. This trend
                    will continue in the coming years with the growth of sensors and artificial intelligence in the
                    automotive industry. The neuro-inspired approach of the VISION AVTR, including so-called neuromorphic
                    hardware, promises to minimise the energy requirements of sensors, chips and other components to a
                    few watts. Their energy supply is provided by the cached current of the integrated solar plates on
                    the back of the VISION AVTR. The 33 multi-directionally movable surface elements act as “bionic flaps”.

            <p class="head_parag_6">Organic battery technology.</p>
            <p class="parag_6">The VISION AVTR was designed in line with its innovative electric drive. This is based on
                a particularly powerful and compact high-voltage battery. For the first time, the revolutionary battery
                technology is based on graphene-based organic cell chemistry and thus completely eliminates rare, toxic
                and expensive earths such as metals. Electromobility thus becomes independent of fossil resources. An
                absolute revolution is also the recyclability by composting, which is 100% recyclable due to the materiality.
                As a result, Mercedes-Benz underlines the high relevance of a future circular economy in the raw materials
                sector.

            <p class="head_parag_7">Extremely confident – <br>and completely without emissions.</p>
            <p class="parag_7">With its four high-performance and near-wheel-built electric motors, the VISION AVTR
                embodies a particularly agile implementation of the vision of a dynamic luxury saloon. With a combined
                engine power of more than 350 kW, the VISION AVTR sets a new benchmark for EQ Power. Thanks to the
                intelligent and fully variable torque distribution, the power of the four fully individually controllable
                motors is not only managed in the best possible way in terms of driving dynamics, but above all in a highly
                efficient manner. The innovative all-wheel drive with torque vectoring enables completely new freedoms and
                guarantees driving dynamics at the highest level while at the same time providing the best possible active
                safety. This means that each wheel can be driven separately and depending on the driving situation. Due to
                the possibility to drive the front and rear axles simultaneously or in opposite ways, the VISION AVTR can
                move sideways by approx. 30 degrees, in contrast to conventional vehicles. The so-called “crab movement”
                gives the concept vehicle a reptile-like appearance even in its movement.
